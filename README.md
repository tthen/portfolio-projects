# portfolio-projects

In this repository I save the principal ideas concerning with some 
projects for share as a portfolio

## Resolve Some Environmental Questions with Calculus

Resolve differential equations for decay rate of pollutants or some 
chemical species in environment. These solutions can be used to determine
the residence time in reactors, and acoustics measurement.

Back-End: Python 3
Front-End: Bootstrap / Materialize


## Patient Document Management

Micro-FronEnds for Microservices for Document Management Systems. 
This project is for use in the management of patients that need to be 
controlled for for treatments, and appointments.

Front-End: React, Bootstrap / Materialize
Back-End: Node, Exopress

## Document Management System

This project is inspired in the ISO 17025 for access control of 
Document

Back-End: Java
Front-end: Bootstrap / Materialize, React

## DevOps with Linux / Unix

This project is for document the learning process in Linux / Unix for 
DevOps skills needed in development and production environment

## API for unit conversion

Conversion of units is necessary for some engineering activities, some 
websites offer this service, but I want to build one page that make this 
tasks, but with some plus in comparison on other pages.

Some conversion factor can be applied to: air pollution, mechanical 
engineering, civil engineering.

Back-End: Python 3

## API for programming languages

I would like to make an API repository for principal programming 
languages, to stored its packages, dependencies, installation in 
several OS, in one site for reference

## AERMOD Modelling System

Repository name: epa-model-airmod

This is a desktop software for modelling air dispersion of criteria 
pollutants. My wish is create a repository and dependencies for use 
the wildcard and tags for use in modelling scenarios
